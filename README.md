# Eclipse Launcher
## Eclipse is a launcher and auto-updater for the indie game Endless Abyss made by @StrawberrySmoothieDev
### Check out the game here: https://smoothiegames.itch.io/endless-abyss
#### NEW UPDATES EVERY MONDAY! (until i run out of ideas)
ONLY MADE FOR WINDOWS (currently), it might be possible to use wine for other OSes but I didn't try that yet.

features:

- game launcher
- simple settings menu
- hides to system tray after successful game launch (currently broken)
- auto check for Endless Abyss executable in some directories like programfiles by default

coming soon:
- auto-updater (v0.1.0)
- better ui (v0.0.2-alpha)
- customizable background image (v0.0.2-beta)
- macos support (v0.1.1-alpha)
and more if i can think of anything other than these or patching bugs

**note: You WILL have to set the file path for Endless Abyss in the settings menu if the launcher couldn't find it or game will not launch.**

_- extra fun stuff: you can set any other app using the file path selector in settings_
